			<p>Cabage ia a web-based application which allows students of IIT Guwahati share taxi to airport or railway staions. The application enables them to interact with  other students who have the   same destination, and share a taxi with them instead of travelling   alone, thereby providing an economical, social and eco-friendly system   of cab-sharing. <!--<h5>Acess prototype from <a href = " http://ssel.kaist.ac.kr/xe/2314" target = "_blank"> here </a> <br/>--></p>

		  <h4>Problem Space </h4>
			<p>Based on  Literature Study we found that major factors affecting car-pooling were : <br />
		    Demographics, Space, motivation, household mobility, work schedule, commute pattern and commute distance.<br />
		    We conducted semi-structured  interviews to know more   about user behavior, expectations and motivations in relation to   travelling and car-pooling. One of the major take-away was tht the application should web-based and not mobile based since users were active online on their laptops for avg. 4-5 hours everyday. After analyzing the user needs and demands, we looked at existing   solution  and the pros and cons in their architecture, design, task   flows etc.

		  <h4>User study and analysis</h4>
			<p>Based on the insights drawn from the user study, we conceptualised the task-flow for the application and designed the wireframes. The designs made sure that user could access the information in minimum number of steps without compromising the privacy and security of the user information.</p>

	    <h4>Design Alternatives</h4>
		  <p>The video was made keeping the branding of application in mind along   with a little entertainment so that the viewer remainsed engaged   throughout. Before working on the storyline, first a concept and style of the video   was brainstormed. References were taken from the viral animated videos   of products and services like google, etc.<br />
            Following methodology has been followed to publish the video:<br />
~Research and study of different concepts and video styles.<br />
~Formulating a storyline for the video.<br />
~Storyboards and animatics including soundtracks and voice-overs.<br />
~Render of the final output.</p></div>
