			<p>Cabage ia a web-based application which allows students of IIT Guwahati share taxi to airport or railway staions. The application enables them to interact with  other students who have the   same destination, and share a taxi with them instead of travelling   alone, thereby providing an economical, social and eco-friendly system   of cab-sharing. <!--<h5>Acess prototype from <a href = " http://ssel.kaist.ac.kr/xe/2314" target = "_blank"> here </a> <br/>--> </p>

		  <h4>User Study and Competetive analysis</h4>
			<p>Based on  Literature Study we found that major factors affecting car-pooling were : <br />
		    Demographics, Space, motivation, household mobility, work schedule, commute pattern and commute distance.<br />
		    We conducted semi-structured  interviews to know more   about user behavior, expectations and motivations in relation to   travelling and car-pooling. After analyzing the user needs and demands, we looked at existing   solution  and the pros and cons in their architecture, design, task   flows etc.

			<h4>Branding</h4> 
			<p> I-sphere is a Web search interface in a 3D hierarchical tree structure wherein pieces of information are associated with represented nodes. The structure has a “root” node from which its child nodes are connected. The “root” node is metaphorically represents the “entire” website containing the information or pages associated with the website. The child nodes of the root node (primary node) is equivalent to “primary navigation menu” of any conventional website. The children of the primary nodes are the pages available on the website. As we go further deep into the structure, we have the hierarchical arrangement of the pages of the website. The interfaces is a 2D-3D hybrid where user can switch between the screen anytime form anywhere on the website. </p>

			<h4>Inspiration and Video-Style</h4> 
		  <p>The prototype is a high fidelity model of the system with basic navigations and options. It makes extensive use of the attributes of the 3D object to display/visualize information like size, color, neighborhood, alignment etc. Since the prototype uses VRML browser, it uses all the navigation techniques provided by it like zoom, pan, rotate, turn, change in viewpoint, dragging etc. Upon clicking the node, it expands to its children node and the associated Web object is displayed on the right hand side of the screen. The prototype is developed as a proof-of-concept and thus is very basic and limited in functionality.  Also, the prototype requires VRML plugin to run which depending on the browser is either pre-installed or has to be installed by the user.<br /></p>

			<h4>Storyboard</h4> 
			<p>The usability evaluation of the interface was conducted with 11 participants with the aim to identify usability issues with the design and test level of satisfaction of the user and acceptance of the interface. The participants were give  representative tasks and then administered with a qualitative questionnaire and System usability Scale (SUS) [Score 60.45, p&lt;0.05]</p>
			<p>Based on the evaluation, it was found that users found the system interesting to use and could learn, understand and remember the interactions, but the 2D to 3D mapping was not intuitive and navigation was cumbersome. There were many other conclusions which informed the design for improvement like dynamic viewpoints, availability of a key to visual elements, introductort tutorial or tool-tip, etc</p>

			<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
			<p>The interface opens another dimension of information visualisation which could be tapped as the information overload increases. Improvements in the mapping of 2D input with 3D navigation can increase the usability of the system. By introducing dynamic database management and selection criteria, the system could be introduced for the e-commerce websites which could largely change the e-commerce marketing and operation scenarios. Also the system has to be evaluated for cross-platform functionality and compressed contents need to be processed for reduced browsing times. The suggested prototype model  has been visualized over a structure similar to a hierarchy tree but the information nodes could be visualized over different structures as well such as Buckminster Fullerene structure or networked mesh using different principles of organizing nodes and links of I-Sphere and mapping different interactive navigational representations.</p>
