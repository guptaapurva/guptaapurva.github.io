			<p>The   project was out in collaboration with JDA Software, a   leader in global supply chain management. The aim of the project was to   create a collaborative dashboard for master planners in the supply chain   industry to aid them in efficient decision making. A user-centered   design approach was followed. Based on the user interviews,   personas and use-cases sent by the client, insights were drawn with   respect to the roles, responsibilities and tasks of master planners.   These insights were used to showcase role specific data i.e   performance based indexes (KPI's), trends, alerts/warnings, deadlines,   etc. on a platform that is seamlessly integrated for both desktops and   other portable devices. Wireframes and mockups were created and a funcional prototype was test built for evaluation<!--<h5>Acess prototype from <a href = " http://ssel.kaist.ac.kr/xe/2314" target = "_blank"> here </a> <br/>-->.</p>

			<h4> Prototype</h4>
			<p>The interface opens another dimension of information visualisation which could be tapped as the information overload increases. Improvements in the mapping of 2D input with 3D navigation can increase the usability of the system. By introducing dynamic database management and selection criteria, the system could be introduced for the e-commerce websites which could largely change the e-commerce marketing and operation scenarios. Also the system has to be evaluated for cross-platform functionality and compressed contents need to be processed for reduced browsing times. The suggested prototype model  has been visualized over a structure similar to a hierarchy tree but the information nodes could be visualized over different structures as well such as Buckminster Fullerene structure or networked mesh using different principles of organizing nodes and links of I-Sphere and mapping different interactive navigational representations.</p>
