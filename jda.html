			<p>The   project was out in collaboration with JDA Software, a   leader in global supply chain management. The aim of the project was to   create a collaborative dashboard for master planners in the supply chain   industry to aid them in efficient decision making. A user-centered   design approach was followed. Based on the user interviews,   personas and use-cases sent by the client, insights were drawn with   respect to the roles, responsibilities and tasks of master planners.   These insights were used to showcase role specific data i.e   performance based indexes (KPI's), trends, alerts/warnings, deadlines,   etc. on a platform that is seamlessly integrated for both desktops and   other portable devices. Wireframes and mockups were created and a funcional prototype was test built for evaluation<!--<h5>Acess prototype from <a href = " http://ssel.kaist.ac.kr/xe/2314" target = "_blank"> here </a> <br/>-->.</p>

			<h4> Understanding the requirements</h4>
			<p>Planners need to constantly take care of facility profiles on map, fiscal calendar, scorecard.They need to see a lot of information at the same time and need to collaborate a lot with others for inquiries and feedback. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "col-xs-12 col-md-6">
			<h4>Affinity Analysis and Task-Flow</h4>
			<p>Once the requirements were chalked out, the personas and the user-stuyd material was critically anaysed. The insghts from the analysis informed the bsic layout of the dashboard and helped in prioritizing functions and features.</p>

			<p>The final iteration was the improvement over the previous ones. This iteration improves upon  information access and interactions with the system. This design for converted into a limited functionality prototype for user evaluation. The following features were introduced and implemented in the prototype.</p>
