				<p>Active Pathways is a tangible tool that enables the collaborative practice of discovery and learning among novices in biochemical modeling. The project is integrated into the environment of the Biomedical Engineering Department at Georgia Tech, where the use of models combines learning with scientific discovery. We build on ethnographic research of the practice and problems in systems biology labs, where novice graduate students try to master a new area and immediately put their knowledge into practice to solve real problems. Using participatory and user-centered design methods, we design, develop, and evaluate tangible/embodied interactions that can facilitate collaborative modeling of biochemical processes by novice researchers. Our process engages students from systems biology research labs and introductory modeling courses. Our longer-term goal is to apply our research outcomes and use our system in research and education in biomedical engineering at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.</p>

				<h4> Contribution and Role </h4>
					<p> As a designer on the team, my role was to imagine multi-device interactions, task flow andVisual design. <br /> 
					<strong>Interaction Design:</strong> Designing Interactions for different devices used as active tokens (Sifteos, Smart watch) and fitting interface on tablet (Touch-based Information Visulaisation). <br>
					<strong>Visual Design:</strong> UI for active token screens (Sifteos, Smart watch) and Fitting interface on Tablet.</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "col-md-12">
				<h4> Interactions </h4>
				<p>The interactions were designed using Sifteos and smart watch which were used as "Active Physical Tokens" on a tabigle tabletop interface. Also, a fitting interface was designed on tablet interface.</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "col-md-12">
				<h4> Interface Design (UI) </h4>
				<p> The UI and the screens were used on the active tokens i.e. Sifteos and Smart watches. A visualisation tool was designed for tablet.</p>
