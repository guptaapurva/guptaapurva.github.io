			<p class="two-column-flow">Tangible user interfaces are becoming part of our life with the emergence of wearable computing and the internet of things. Tangible User Interfaces give us the power to alter the coupling between physical and digital data [1] i.e. input and output can be computationally coupled. When a computer acts as a mediator between input and output, a wide array of input-output coupling are possible. Having the freedom to choose the input and coupling gives designers flexibility to generate a wide variety of interaction styles or gestures for product interaction. While this might be an opportunity for designers, the effort required from users while interacting with everyday products can be enormous. This brings forth an inherent need to design gestures in such a way that it reduces cognitive effort of the user.</p>

			<p>Kirk et al. [2] highlight that the kinesthetic memory of moving a tangible object can help in reducing the risk of mode errors by increasing the awareness of performed actions. Gestures add a benefit of reduced cognition [3] to 3D manipulation of a tangible object [2]. However, Norman [4] points out that, using gestures can have side effects such as misrecognition and poor designs of the gesture-to-function mapping.s</p>

To counter poor designs of the gesture-to-function mapping, it is paramount to adhere to a user-centered design process. In this paper we provide a case study where we designed gestures for a cushion remote based on the users’ previous interaction with the product (in this case a cushion).</p>
