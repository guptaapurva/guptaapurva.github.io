				<p>r/TrollXChromosomes, a subreddit within reddit.com, has over 180,000 subscribers on reddit, not to mention lurkers who read the subreddit without creating an account.  r/TrollXChromosomes developed as an offshoot of another subreddit dedicated to female perspectives (r/TwoXChromosomes), and was originally devoted to sharing and commenting on rage-comics and memes centering female perspectives. Five years after its inception, it has developed an identity of its own and has truly become a Third Place (Oldenburg, 1999) for women on the Internet. 
Via participant observation and semi-structured interviews of the community members, we sought to understand why women (and men) participate in this online community, the main themes of content shared and discussed of the community, and to gain a deeper insight into how the community works. Through a combination of participant observation and semi-structured interviews of r/TrollXChromosomes members, we discovered why members are drawn to the community, along with emergent themes defining the siteâ€™s experience - such as support, authenticity and humor.

				<p> The  goal of the stakeholder-user study was to understand the broader sales cycle,  capture the pain points around current demo request and delivery processes, and  gauge requirements for the upcoming demo. Semi-structured  interviews were conducted with 18 stakeholders involved at various stages of the sales process (Solutions Consultant, Sales Managers, Channel Development  Managers, Project Managers). Each  interview session lasted for approx. 30 minutes during which there were questions around  their prevalent processes, their challenges and pain points and their  perceptions and aspirations for the newer product version  and the corresponding  version of the sales demo. Interviews  were conducted over phone which were recorded and analyzed.</p>
