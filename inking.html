				<h3>Pen-Based-Gestures for augmenting digital writing experience and capabilities</h3>

				<p>The project was done in collaboration with Microsoft IDC, India. The project introduces a pen-based gestural interactions for digital note taking application designed for tablets. The application  leverages the experience of paper and the power of digital medium to create more productive content. The application is designed for college students who are required to take notes regularly. The interaction model introduces the concept of “second-screen”- an overlay over the input-space on the screen to initiate and perform gesture without disrupting the flow of the task. The gestures are inspired from the day-to-day interactions that people do while making notes or documenting information. The design of interactions was achieved by following a user-centered design process involving an extensive user study through semi-structured interviews and activity-based analysis of user’s interactions with pen, paper and tablets. The concept is further expanded to include tasks which enable the user to become a power user and accomplish other tasks associated with the application efficiently.<!--<h5>Acess prototype from <a href = " http://ssel.kaist.ac.kr/xe/2314" target = "_blank"> here </a> <br/>--> </p>

				<h4>Understanding the Requirement</h4>
				<p>We followed a user centered design process and conducted Preceptual walkthrough, Role playing, Semi-structured interviews and Activity based task analysis with paper-pen and tablet-stylus. We also did a literature review of pen computing to understand the strnghts and limitations of existing technology. We conducted a competetive analysis of available application in the market to understand the most common and desirable features and look for potential gaps n the existing solutions.</p>

				<h4>Decision points</h4>
				<p>~Limitaion of screen space since input-output space is same. <br />
				  ~Preventing error by mis-interpretation of gesture as text. Thus, introduction of the  second screen is a trade off between error preventions and addition of extra steps<br />
				  ~Multiple access points to perform the same function<br />
				  ~Catalog for recently used Functions for quick access <br />
				~Mode Change Mechanism for changing from second screen to main screen</p>

				<h4> Concept and Mockups</h4>
				<p>Based on the insights from the user study, we designed an inking app aimed at college students who frequently take and share notes. The app introduces the concept of “second screen”. This second screen is an unobtrusive mode where user can take notes and perform functions on it. Once the user opens the app and begins writing, he long presses the stylus, to mark or highlight text. A translucent overlay appears on the top the screen referred to as “second screen”. User can select the text here and perform the gesture like “question mark” for marking doubts, “star” for important, etc. Once the actions are completed on this screen, the user can long press to exit the screen and continue writing.</p>

				<h4>Insights</h4>
				<p>The user study revealed that there still are gaps in representing the actual feel of pen-paper. This project attempted to go one step closer in reducing the gap. The application is still in the mockup phase. It has to be test build and evaluated to validate all the design decisions that were undertaken. Pen based gestures discussed  are still limited to only few gestures, mostly due to the argument of limited number of gestures that users can remember. But by having multiple gestures and keywords for same function and adding user defined gestures, we can increase the usability of system. Moreover these gestures can be standardized across devices for increased memorability. The users also mentioned difficulty in managing their notes. The proposed solution can be integrated with better techniques of storing and archiving the notes for better retrieval.</p>
