				<p>I interned at Ebay Enterprise over the Summer of 2015. The goal of this 11 week exercise  was to follow the &quot;Customer Driven Innovation&quot; process to better understand the sales demo ecosystem,  pinpoint major flaws in the process and redesign the current request-delivery  pipeline for efficiency and automation. </p>
				<p>My  work revolved around designing the knowlegde portal/platform for the internal teams to request and seek support for the different flavors of the demo instances. I followed the design philosophy of &quot;Customer Driven Innovation&quot; used across ebay products. My work included understanding the sales process specifically the demo ecosystem by conducting stakeholder interviews across different teams, analysing them and designing a web based portal based on the prevalent sales process. I also designing an infographic to be used a knowledge tool for understanding various flavors and features of sales demo.</p>

				<h4>Customer Driven Innovation - The Process</h4>
				<p>Customer Driven Innovation (CDI) is a  repeatable method for creating great ideas and products. It is  based on a rigorous understanding of your customers and their needs. Developed from the principles of Design Thinking by  the Stanford d.School,  similar variations are in use at companies across the world, such as PayPal,  eBay, Google, IDEO, Lego, and many more.</p>

				<h4>Stakeholder Interviews and Problem Identification</h4>
				<p> The  goal of the stakeholder-user study was to understand the broader sales cycle,  capture the pain points around current demo request and delivery processes, and  gauge requirements for the upcoming demo.
				Semi-structured  interviews were conducted with 18 stakeholders involved at various stages of  the sales process (Solutions Consultant, Sales Managers, Channel Development  Managers, Project Managers)
				Each  interview session lasted for approx. 30 minutes during which there were questions around  their prevalent processes, their challenges and pain points and their  perceptions and aspirations for the newer product version  and the corresponding  version of the sales demo.
				Interviews  were conducted over phone which were recorded and analyzed.</p>

				<p><strong>Insights from Affinity Analysis</strong><br>
				There was no defined processes around  request-delivery of sales demo or prospect 2-week trial. No defined support processes around the  sales demo were present. Members of the Solutions Innovation team were called directly for  assistance. There was a lack of training and knowledge material. Configuring the demo was a time-intensive  task and involved a slight learning curve. There was a Lack of peer-to-peer  discussion and support and no visibility into previously customized  demos (history). Other insights on desirable features for the new demo version and pain points were gained.</p>
