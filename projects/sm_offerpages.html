          <h2> Offer Pages </h2>

          <blockquote>“The simplicity of the site. Just enough information presented and very easy to navigate.”</blockquote>

          <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_1.png" width="100%" />

  				<h4>Background</h4>
            <p>A lot of free credit score solutions in the market make money by cross-selling credit cards and loans from big financial institutions (FI's) or 3rd party vendors. This poses as risk to credit unions and small banks as they lose wallet share despite competitive rates. <br><br>

            SavvyMoney allows partner FI's to market their loan offers directly to their members inside the credit score application using its powerful recommendation engine. This not only adds to a marketing channel for partners but also allow their users to explore savings options and avail the cheaper rates that most credit unions are known for.</p>

          <h4>Challenges with the existing solution</h4>
            <p>Originally, there was a single page on the SavvyMoney application with all the offers listings. There was a small input selector for each product type to capture user details and a carousel to list other offer listings in the same category.</p>

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_2.png" width="100%" />

            <p>There were a few challenges with the existing page. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The <b>navigation </b> to other offers in the same product type was un-intuitive.</li>
              <li>The <b>value proposition</b> and/or savings for the offer were less apparent and hidden under "Your Savings".</li>
              <li>Overall it was difficult for the user to identify if the offer was <b>personalized</b> for them or if they were saving on their existing loans. </li>
              <li><b>Tracking </b>: Since all the offers were listed in one page, current implementation of the page made it difficult to track what offers were being interacted with. </li>
            </ol>

          <h4>Motivations</h4>
            <p>The primary motivation was to fix the user experience of the offers area. As the project unfolded, larger questions and concerns came into light which led to simplification of this complex product feature. The larger offer page undertaking was driven by:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Ease of use</b>:Ease of use: Content is easy to navigate and understand. 
              There are many examples of research that people don't usually understand a lot of information presented to them when they apply for loans. So one of the focus areas was to make sure content was easy to understand and comprehend.</li>
              <li><b>Transparency</b>:Expose what the user will pay and how much (if at all) would the user save with the recommended offer.</li>
              <li><b>Ease of comparison</b>: Better visual way to compare all available offers than existing solution.</li>
              <li><b>Consideration of edge cases</b>: Data analysis revealed that only around 40–50% of the user base will ever see any offer. Others might either not be eligible for any offer or not have savings. Thus, the next version of designs should take care of as much of the edge cases as possible while leaving enough leeway for users to explore on their own.</li>
              <li><b>Modularity</b>: De-constructing the architecture of the page which lets efficient implementation of all use cases while allowing the partners modify the marketing text and disclosure around the offers.</li>
              <li><b>Consistency</b>: While each product type has its own unique characteristics and nuances, it is imperative that they looked and felt as a part of a single underlying product.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Project scope/timeline</h4>
            <p>This has been a larger undertaking which involved designing and building individual pages and functionality for different product types -</p>

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_3.png" width="100%" />

            <ul>
              <li>Credit Cards</li>
              <li>Auto Loans</li>
              <li>Personal Loan</li>
              <li>Student Loans</li>
              <li>Home Loans / HELOC </li>
              <li>Other products that partners offer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The project kickstarted as a partner request to support "Student Loans" category. This was undertaken as an opportunity to redo the "Savings" area with a more consolidated page per product type. Each of the product types were split into individual projects and underwent through their independent design and development cycles.</p>

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_4.png" width="100%" />

            <h4>My role</h4>
            <p>I wore many hats for this project other than leading the UX efforts. I acted as a researcher and business analyst to identify feature requirements and worked directly with the partners and the development team to spec out, design and build the functionality.</p>

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>These pages were built one by one, such that certain nuances particular to the product type could be addressed properly. The process for building these page involved:</p>

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_5.png" width="100%" />

            <ol>
              <li>Understanding the space of each product -product characteristics, lending criteria and lending process. This was done by talking to partners, SME's, user surveys and looking at existing market research data.</li>
              <li>Looking at the user data to understand the use cases and edge case scenarios.</li>
              <li>Building task-flows , UI architecture and interaction model and low-mid fidelity mockups.</li>
              <li>Testing with Partners for initial feedback to understand if the concept matched the industry standards.</li>
              <li>Building high fidelity,  semi- functional prototype and testing for usability, user-satisfaction, aesthetic appeal and ease of use with users.</li>
              <li>Building model calculators for each product type for backend calculations.</li>
                <li>Finalizing  the UI and handing off the project to the developers with detailed requirements and UI specification.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Since the pages were built one-by-one, this was truly an iterative project. Every next product page was informed by the performance of the previous pages and the improvements were implemented across all the pages.</p>

            <h4>Outcome and design artifacts</h4>
            <p>This project is still ongoing with iterative changes and enhancement to features. As of Q3 2018, the improved functionality and UI was in production for Auto Loans, Student Loans, Personal Loans, Credit Cards, Home Loans and a generic offer page for all other offer types, both in web and mobile.</p>

            Page Anatomy
            An interesting attribute of offers within SavvyMoney is that they are from one partner. This means, the partner will only have a few loans of each type. For example, some financial institution only carry 1 credit card, or only offer 3–4 loan term for auto loan. This knowledge was important in deciding how to layout the page.
            Each offer type had its own characteristics and nuances. While not all the details can be covered here, some common components are discussed below.
            New Loans
            The goal on new loan pages was to let the user explore monthly payments for different loan terms while letting them compare offers.

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_7.png" width="100%" />

            The key sections of page include:
            User workspace to calculate their monthly payment

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_8.png" width="100%" />

            One interaction that was added to the loan amount field was the ability to allow users to add/reduce loan amounts in steps of $500 while giving the ability to edit the value.

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_9.png" width="100%" />

            Compare section to compare all available eligible offers.

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_10.png" width="100%" />

            Loan benefits section where custom text per partner can be added to the page.
            Disclosures section where customized disclosures and disclaimers can be added to the page.

            Refinance/Debt Consolidation pages
            This was an interesting purpose of some of the offer types. While there are many cross-selling platforms out there, SavvyMoney has a unique positioning, since it can compare loan options against user’s existing loans and truly help them see money saving options. Thus, key principle for these pages was transparency.
            - Visibility into to existing loan,
            - The cost benefit of refinance/consolidation and
            - The ability to compare all offers in one place.

            Thus key sections of page contained:

            Existing loan selection which has information about user’s loan as reported in their credit reports —remaining balance, remaining loan term and monthly payment. APR was calculated using the available information.
            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_11.png" width="100%" />

            A user workspace to see one loan at a time and compare their monthly savings, interest savings and APR reductions.
            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_12.png" width="100%" />

            Compare section to compare all available eligible offers.
            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_13.png" width="100%" />

            Loan benefits section where custom text per partner can be added to the page.
            Disclosures section where customized disclosures and disclaimers can be added to the page.

            Workflow Diagrams
            The diagrams were drawn based on usage data and user’s credit. For example, for auto loans it was found that only 60% of the representative dataset had an open auto loan with a balance > $0. Thus, diagram were improved and fallback scenarios were added for such users. For each subsequent, offer page, the diagrams were improved for consistency in scenarios, code and design.

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_14.png" width="100%" />

            Fallback Scenarios
            These were states which the user will see if they don’t qualify for an eligible loan, for example, due to their low score, location or loan amount. Also, these states included any interruption to service or any unknown states. The idea was to show relevant information to the users so that they can act on it appropriately.

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_16.png" width="100%" />

            Calculation model
            Calculation models were made for developers to build the backend logic. Each product type had its own unique characteristics which influenced the calculations of monthly payments, interest amount and overall savings.

            <img src="../img/sm_images/offers/ofr_17.png" width="100%" />


            <h4>Take Away</h4>
            <p>Being an outsider to the fin-tech industry, this project helped me get the exposure to the world of financial institutions, the nuances of how, for example, credit cards or Auto loans works, what factors are important for the lenders and what goes into the process of loan underwriting. Who new your ownership of your house can pay for you next house!! Or you could get more than the value of your car as an auto loan to pay for your debt since APR of any asset based loan is much lower than a personal loan! <br>
            I also built  model calculators which could calculate credit card payments, monthly loan payments and pay-off loan terms. <br>

            I collaborated with 2 remote teams based out of the country across different time-zones and truly experienced round-the-clock work concept. It not only helped me improve my communication skills (some of the team that I worked with did not have English as their first language) but also appreciate the importance of designer-developer collaboration for a successful project. <br>

            My most important takeaway from the project was the <b> importance of consistency </b> - not only in UI, across different components, content, layout, etc. but also code - the api calls being returned, consistency in calculation results, number of decimal points, calculation in cents vs dollars, etc. This is when I took a step back and evaluated all pages for inconsistencies. This led way to setup a Design System at SavvyMoney - OCTANE.</p>

            <blockquote>It is easy to design and build in a silo when you are focussed on task based output, losing the sight the bigger picture. It is then when you overstep consistency for getting the work done.</blockquote>
