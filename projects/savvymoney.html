It ofers a comprehensive credit score solution (score, report and monitoring) to financial institutions (FI's) by integrating within their online and mobile banking platforms.

          <h4>my role</h4>
          <p>When I joined SavvyMoney in 2016, I was the only designer on the team. I started as a UX designer focusing mainly on enhancing the users’ experience with the credit score application. Since then, not only have I grown my role, but also contributed towards creating a strong design culture in the company. I work within the product team, lead a team of designers and UI developers and work closely with the partnerships team to plan and implement enhancements and/or new feature roll-outs. I also wear the business analyst hat and analyze the impact of design interventions and evaluate growth of both product and partners.</p>

          <h4>design-led product development process</h4>
          <p>I take pride in working closely with the product team in institutionalizing a product development process which is pro-design, end-to-end. The human-centered design philosophy forms the foundation of the process that instills the idea of technology and design working together for successful releases.</p>

          <h4>product evolution</h4>
          <p>When I started, the credit application was limited to the credit score, factors that affect the score, credit monitoring, a page dedicated to the FI's offers and a blog which was largely un-responsive. I have worked on the complete overhaul of the application along with designing additional features.</p>

          <h3>Automating user acess and simplifying user on-boarding process</h3>
          <p>One of the challenges with the user access process was that it was manual and took up to an hour for a user. Also, user sign-up was not real time. From the time user requested access, it could take anywhere from 1-2 business days for them to get access with credential which were not secured.</p>
          <p>I re-designed the user access process leveraging the tools that were already being used, to automate the process  and making user sign-up realtime. This resulted in a more efficient process saving up to 10-15 hours per month while providing a better user experience.</p>

          <h3>Making way for design system and accessibility </h3>
          <p>While working on these design projects, we occassionally ran into the issue of managing assets and design files. One major issue was that same components were not consistent in the design source files. Similar problem co-existed within the dev team too where each new UI developer would re-code the components. This resulted in the designs not only looking different from production but similar components looked different on different pages.</p>
          <p>As a solution to the problem, we introduced a component library which helped in mainiting a level on consistency within the design team. But development inconsistency was still a problem. As we transitioned our web technology from angular to react, it gave us an oppotunity to set up the design system that can be used  by everyone as a single source of truth. Hence, the birth of,</p>
          <h4>OCTANE - Design System by SavvyMoney</h4>
          <p>Though the designs system is still under works, the success of the system lies in the fact that early on dev team recognized the value of the system as they added new UI developers to the projects. They were now seeing reduced development time. This not only helped in spreading awareness about the design system withing teams but get executive buy-in too. Easy!! ;) </p>
          <h4>ACCESSIBILITY</h4>
          <p>Since SavvyMoney works directly with financial institutions, some of whom are ADA compliant, it has become implicit for SavvyMoney to be ADA compliant. The design system helped us in taking the first steps towards that. The components being built into the system follow the WCAG 2.0 guidelines with specific focus on color, contrast, target sizes and text guildelines. </p>
