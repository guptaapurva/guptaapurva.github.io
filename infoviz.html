				<h4>Design Brief</h4>
				<p>The visualisation compares 35 US cities on 17 different metrics across ease of moving around [Transportation], cost of living, quality of neighbourhood, living quality [#music venues, #coffee shops, etc] and employment statistics. The metrics are chosen based on its relevancy and &nbsp;importance for young adults if they were choosing among multiple cities. They are able to have the overview as well as detailed comparison among several cities they focus on.</p>

			  <h4>Problem Description</h4>
				<p>Choosing between multiple cities to live in could be a daunting task specially for internationals who are new to the foreign land or young adults looking to relocate when starting the next chapter of their lives.They may be considering more than one option, however, finding and comparing information about the cities and picking one is both resource and time intensive. The viualisatio is aimed to help young people especially new college graduates who are considering relocation or people who just want to know more, explore, compare and rank different cities. </p>
