			<h3>Exploration of Shape-Change as a Feedback Modality in Tangible User Interface (TUI)</h3>

			<p>TUI’s have been explored for over two decades and have majorly used visual and audio elements as feedback modality to demonstrate reactions from the system. This project was an attempt to design a Tangible thermostat using shape change as a feedback modality. This system was then compared with a similar system designed using non-screen based visual metaphor as feedback modality. The qualitative evaluation was conducted with 10 users to investigate usability, preference and satisfaction of the users while interacting with these systems. System Usability Scale and Attrakdiff were employed to evaluate above parameters. The results suggest that shape change as a feedback fared better to convey system status and ordinal information whereas visual system fared better for quantitative information. Also, usability of shape-change system increased when in was introduced to the users after visual system and it was also deemed attractive and user-friendly by the users. Thus, we argue that shape change as feedback modality has vast potential which is yet to be explored and tapped.<!--<h5>Acess prototype from <a href = " http://ssel.kaist.ac.kr/xe/2314" target = "_blank"> here </a> <br/>--></p>

		  <h4>Understanding the domain</h4>
		  <p>We did a qualitative literature review of 40 papers from 19983-2013 to understand the trends and developments TUI research. We analysed them and abstracted gaps in the reseach one of which was feedback in Tangible interfaces. SInce, shape change is being explored in input-output space, we tried to experiment about its effects as a feedback modlaity. <br />

			<h4>System design</h4>
			<p>Many factors affected the decision to choose a relevant context like familiar context of use, non-existance of inherent feedback and representation of  different types of information like system status, ordinal information, quantitative information. Hence we designed portable thermostat/AC controller with three major interactions a) Switching system ON-OFF, b) Temperature control through increasing or decreasing temperature c) Change of mode between cool and dry</p>

            <div class = "col-xs-12 col-md-6"> 
				<h4>Shape Change System</h4>
				<p>The system was designed in form of a cylinder with capacitive upper surface which when pressed, cause the surface to fall and then rise as if breathing. Both temperature and modes are controlled via a ring on the surface of the cylinder which can freely rotate along the z-axis. Rotating the ring controls temperature and squeezing the ring controls the mode. The system  changes its height in response to change in  temperature. Pressing or squeezing the ring initiates change in surface texture causing change in mode.</p>
			</div>
        
			<div class = "col-xs-12 col-md-6"> 
				<h4>Visual System</h4>
				<p>Interactions to operate the functions were kept same for both the system. When the capacitive upper surface of the cylinder is pressed, the system switches ON and all the lights come to life. The rotation of the ring controls the temperature change and corresponding number of LED‟s are switched on. When the ring is squeezed the mode changes and the respective LED for the mode is turned on. </p>

			<h4>Protoype</h4>
			<p>To maintain the compactness of the designed system and due to technological constraints, the standalone controller with capacitive surface and ring model was replaced with a table-top interface and token-model for input. Also, for texture, a sector of the curved surface area instead of the whole surface area was considered. Putting the token on table started the system and removing it switched it off. The rotation of the token in clockwise direction increased the temperature and rotating it in anti-clockwise direction decreased the temperature. Changing its side caused change in	      mode for AC. LEDs were used to provide feedback in visual systems, whereas height change and texture change were used to provide feedback to the users in shape-changing system</p>

			<h4>Evaluation</h4>
			<p>			  The evaluation was conducted with 10 participants using within subject design in a controlled lab environment. The systems were randomly assigned to the participants to reduce the bias. The output screen was set-up behind the users .Four representative tasks were conducted sequentially in one session which appeared in a presentation.  The whole session lasted for 30-45 minutes.
		    After each system, participants were given a system usability scale [SUS] and asked to fill the Attradiff questionnaire [only with shape change system]. After both systems, a post-study questionnaire was given assessing user preference.</p>

			<h4>Analysis</h4>
			<p>The analysis revealed that shape-change feedback fared well in terms of attractiveness which can be further improved for usability and association with the product. Though the SUS score was just below average, observation suggest that those scores improved when the shape change system was introduced after the visual system hinting that usage over time may affect user‟s understanding of the system processes positively.The results also suggest that shape change as a feedback fared better to convey system status and ordinal information whereas non-screen visual fared better for quantitative information. </p>

			<h4>Insights</h4>
			<p>		    Shape Changing Interface have dynamic feedback quality. Change occurring due to shape change, due to its spatial quality can be noticed over a distance. Thus, such a feedback can be effectively used where light and sound feedback may be difficult to catch attention. Explorations can also be done to make it more comprehensible for quantitative information. The same study can be replicated and performed for more number of users with a different use case to explore various other user behaviors while interacting with such systems. Also, the major constraint in this area that we faced and acknowledge is the lack of reconfigurable actuated material for exploration. Thus more of DIY tools need to be explored to mimic the interactions of actual shape transformations.</p>
